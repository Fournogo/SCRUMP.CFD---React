# SCRUMP.CFD---React
Front end rewrite of scrump weather in React.js. Scrump weather was never intended to be complicated which got it started on the wrong foot. 
I decided to go ahead and rewrite everything for React before it got any further out of hand

Scrump weather was my first time touching javascript (or any real web development) and likewise, this was my first time touching react.
There are probably some dumb mistakes or poor architecture decisions made at various levels of this project but you gotta start somewhere ig
